Write Your Own Pong - [https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-pong/](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-pong/)

Chosen programming language and development environment: JS, HTML and CSS

While investigating, I found MDN web docs Game Development tutorials here: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials); so I'm following 2 Breakout tutorials:

1. [Using pure JavaScript](breakout.html)
2. [Using Phaser](breakout_ph.html)

I'm adding the final code here for reference. Then, I'll try to create a version of Pong based on said tutorials.
